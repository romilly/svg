# Python SVG generator

This is a simple python package for generating svg documents.

It's evolved though use in four projects over the last ten years;
most recently I used it in [breadboarder](https://github.com/romilly/breadboarder)
which now depends on it as an external package.

I have separated it out as I now have other current projects which use it.

Tests and docs coming Real Soon Now(tm)
